Increase Cost Notes: 

To redesign system with bigger expenditure, I suppose to raise up the computing capability. 
1. EC2 instance type is changed to “c5ad.xlarge”(Compute Optimized), 
2. Dtabase gets more storage for backups (10000GB)
3. Route53 adds features for getting lower latency.  



Decrease Cost Note: 
1. Using smaller EC2 instance type (t2.2xlarge)
2. Reducing amount of disk of database backups (1000GB)
3. Cutting off resources for CloudFront. (Data transfer out to internet (10000 GB per month), Data transfer out to origin (1000 GB per month), Number of requests (HTTPS) (1000000 per month)
)
